\section{Conclusion}
DuraChain will help durable medical equipment providers offer more efficient patient care with an innovative, all-in-one solution that decreases costs and the sales order life cycle.  We've also discussed how DuraChain can be scaled beyond \textsc{dme} and be used by all participants in the patient care process.%

With our focus on providing a fast, accurate, and secure way for providers to interact with patient data, we will fix longstanding problems in healthcare and realize a patient-first paradigm.%

\subsection{Next Steps}
The success of DuraChain and the future we envision hinges on \textsc{dme} providers choosing our environment over our competitors. The ensure that we position ourselves strongly, we will be implementing a test environment that select \textsc{dme} providers will get early access to.%

Using the feedback obtained from testing and the selected providers, we will make any necessary changes before deploying on a larger scale.%

\subsection{Future}
While DuraChain's present focus is on fixing issues that face \textsc{dme}, our long term plan is to address healthcare data as a whole and to insert ourselves as an integral part of the patient care process.%

We believe that success in this goal relies on placing as much power as possible into the hands of all healthcare providers everywhere. As we've discussed in this paper, DuraChain is well-positioned to catalyze the necessary shift in patient data.%
