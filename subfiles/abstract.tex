\begin{abstract}
We outline a practical application of an electronic health event environment implemented using distributed ledger technology. Such an environment will allow providers of health care, medical equipment, and insurance to more effectively provide care for their patients, reduce delivery times, and eliminate issues with billing. We also provide details about how electronic health events can be further developed so as to allow for use of our technology in all areas of healthcare delivery. With the right tool and proper deployment, electronic health events have the potential to radically transform the management of healthcare data.\\\\
